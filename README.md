•	The current implementation includes running the program **nativly and in multithreading mode**, and counting the duration of each.

to run the code please change the direction of the images from path( **in line 18 at th_main.cpp**:  DIR *dir = opendir("C:/Users/Naama Levy/Desktop/personal/jobs/greeneye/cpp_project/cmake-build-debug/images"); ) to the path you saved the files (...cpp_project\cmake-build-debug\images)

•	I managed to run over the folder and manipulate each file, but I had some issues with trying setting up OpenCV, so the files are being saved to the folder but aren’t displayed on the screen.


•	 I spent much time on trying setup Boost libraries, in order to run the program im multi-processes mode, but I didn't manage to install it properly. I added the file named "pro_main.cpp - which includes my code for multi-process, that I wrote (without debugging and running).
