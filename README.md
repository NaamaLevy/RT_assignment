# cpp_greeneye_project
to run the code please change the direction of the images to the path you saved the files (...cpp_project\cmake-build-debug\images)

•	I managed to run over the folder and manipulate each file, but I had some issues with trying setting up OpenCV, so the files are being saved to the folder but aren’t displayed on the screen.
•	The concurrent implementation did not go well in this time frame, as I had some difficulties in implement the thread pool, so I preferred to submit the runnable code without multithreads/processes. 
•	I wish I had more time to implement both and compare their behaviour. I think, in this case threads would be more economical and logical, as they share the same memory (images to convert). 
•	I assume multiprocessing would be more efficient if the dafa is divided first, so each processes has its own memory. In this case I guess it will take less runtime than multithreads.
